# The script reads the National Emissions Inventory dataset, obtains a subset, 
# and generates a 'points and lines' plot as 'plot5.png' file as required to
# answer the question 'How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed 
# from 1999â€“2008 in Baltimore City?'
# ANSWER: Significant decrease in PM2.5 emission from 1999 to 2002, then almost 
# none to slight increase from 2002 to 2005 followed by a steady increase from
# 2005 to 2008. 
# Answer is are based on the generated plot.

# PRE-REQUISITES:
#   (1) Installed 'dplyr' package (if not installed: 'install.packages("dplyr")')
#   (2) Installed 'ggplot2' package (if not installed: 'install.packages("ggplot2")')
#   (3) This script expects the file 'summarySCC_PM25.rds' and
