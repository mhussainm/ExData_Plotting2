# The script reads the National Emissions Inventory dataset, obtains a subset, 
# and generates a 'points and lines' plot as 'plot4.png' file as required to
# answer the question 'Across the United States, how have emissions from 
# coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999â€“2008?'
# ANSWER: PM2.5 Emissions reduced from 1999 to 2002, a slight increase from 2002
# to 2005 and a significant decrease from 2005 to 2008.
# Answer is are based on the generated plot.

# PRE-REQUISITES:
#   (1) Installed 'dplyr' package (if not installed: 'install.packages("dplyr")')
#   (2) Installed 'ggplot2' package (if not installed: 'install.packages("ggplot2")')
#   (3) This script expects the file 'summarySCC_PM25.rds' and
